# Vehicle-Control-System
This is a virtual system for a Vehicle. System gets choices from user and responds depending on sensors' readings in the vehicle for achieving a luxury and safe features for the user.
I will mention the used key features which are :
- (Structures) for sensors readings that describe statements of car parts like engine's speed and room temperature.
- preprocessor directives like (#if) and (#define).
- Embedded c (extern) keyword.
- (pointers) to access structures.

Manage vehicle control system :
- Turn vehicle engine on or off.
- Control vehicle temperature using AC.
- control engine temperature using engine temperature controller.
- control car speed according to traffic color.
- Set temperature of vehicle and temperature of engine in specific situations using required equation.
